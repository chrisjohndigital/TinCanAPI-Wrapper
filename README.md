TinCanAPI-Wrapper
==========================

Skeleton Backbone wrapper for Tin Can API reporting.  Wrapper takes the document location and first h1 and p tags from the DOM to generate an 'experienced' Tin Can statement and store on a configured Learning Record Store (LRS).

Add more verbs then add and bind to variable changes on the model to expand reporting.
